to genrated test there are many websites one which i find is the best is 
https://devskiller.com/coding-tests-skill/data-science/
the test link can be sent via email present in the csv file which can also be 
automated using python mentioned in(automated_email_writing.py) 
this webisites have multiple category test for data scientist hiring you can talk to 
them and negociate the priceing in according to your budget.
If your company freqently deals with hiring process or your company's buisness model 
is to select best candidates for hiring then i highly advice that add a test section
to your companys website and hire a person for creating new questions or use you existing
staff or hire me to create such test as it is very easy you just need to create a web page
consisting question :-
1. there should be login by email id as mentioed in resume
2. 1st part should be mcq part where the skills are tested and set the timer such that 
   the person should get the time pressure factor 
3. create an AI(using 'OpenCV' and CNN for face , eye tracking , object detection , background noice detection 
   if the user camera detects multiple face or the field of view goes beyound the screen frequently
   or a smart phone is detetcetd or sound disturbance is heard he should get 3 warnings and after that 
   if the machine still detects some malicious activity the test should terminate 
   and should be awarded with 0 marks 
4. there should be a coding test containig problem statement and test cases (chat gpt
   cant pass test cases as per my experince as it has short memory) hosted 
   using virtual machine the virtual machine will detect the keboard data as people 
   might copy paste the code from chatgpt so the keyboard in virtal machine will detetct 
   it the same AI mentioned above should be present for malisious activity detection
5. the final score should be stored in the data base i personally prefere (sql) 
   now you can create a passing criteria the candidats who will pass will get 
   shortlisted for the interview process
