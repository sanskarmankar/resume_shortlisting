the model_testing.ipnb file contains the code in this code :
1. i have transformend the "available for work" or not as we cant work with numeric 
   values.
2. i have calculated the skill match score on the basis of key word matching the 
   key word matching is a task where we need to input the key skills you are
   searching for in a candidate as some skill mentioned can be useless so you 
   directly filter out the skills as per your requirnement i have entered the skills
   as an example you can enter keys as per your requinement 
3. the overall match percentage column is created where the overall key word match
   is stored 
4. now i have filterd the candidate with the match percentage less than 75% by 
   deleting there data from the data set and then i have stored it in new csv file
   "updated_file1.csv" 
5. now from "updated_file1" i have filtered out candidates with a score of 0 from 
   the mentioned skill "python skills,machine learning skills,nlp skills and deep 
   learning skills" and stored the remaning into csv file "updated_file3.csv" 
6. finally from "updated_file2" i have removed the persons who are not ready to 
   start work immidietly and stored the remaning into new csv file"updated_file3"

  so the best fit candidates are now stored in "updated_file3"
